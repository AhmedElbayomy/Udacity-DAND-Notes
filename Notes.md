                                                understand population parameters.
                                                
- MACHINE LEARNING : Techniques aimed at helping us draw conclusions about individuals in our population.

- BONFERRONI CORRECTION : Method for correcting type I error threshold when we perform more than one hypothesis test.

- With larger sample sizes, STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE becomes less relevant

## Descriptive Statistics

**Descriptive statistics** is about describing our collected data using the measures discussed throughout this lesson: measures of center, measures of spread, shape of our distribution, and outliers. We can also use plots of our data to gain a better understanding.

## Inferential Statistics

**Inferential Statistics** is about using our collected data to draw conclusions to a larger population. Performing inferential statistics well requires that we take a sample that accurately represents our population of interest.

Important terms-

    - Population - our entire group of interest.
    - Parameter - numeric summary about a population
    - Sample - subset of the population
    - Statistic numeric summary about a sample

 Common hypothesis tests include:

   - Testing a population mean [One sample t-test](http://sites.utexas.edu/sos/guided/inferential/numeric/claim/one-sample-t/)

   - Testing the difference in means [Two sample t-test](https://www.isixsigma.com/tools-templates/hypothesis-testing/making-sense-two-sample-t-test/)

   - Testing the difference before and after some treatment on the same individual [Paired t-test](http://www.statstutor.ac.uk/resources/uploaded/paired-t-test.pdf)

   - Testing a population proportion [One sample z-test](https://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=one-sample%20z-test)

   - Testing the difference between population proportions [Two sample z-test](https://newonlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat414/node/268/)
