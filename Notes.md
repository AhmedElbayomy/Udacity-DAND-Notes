                                                understand population parameters.
                                                
- MACHINE LEARNING : Techniques aimed at helping us draw conclusions about individuals in our population.

- BONFERRONI CORRECTION : Method for correcting type I error threshold when we perform more than one hypothesis test.

- With larger sample sizes, STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE becomes less relevant

## Descriptive Statistics

**Descriptive statistics** is about describing our collected data using the measures discussed throughout this lesson: measures of center, measures of spread, shape of our distribution, and outliers. We can also use plots of our data to gain a better understanding.

## Inferential Statistics

**Inferential Statistics** is about using our collected data to draw conclusions to a larger population. Performing inferential statistics well requires that we take a sample that accurately represents our population of interest.

Important terms-

    - Population - our entire group of interest.
    - Parameter - numeric summary about a population
    - Sample - subset of the population
    - Statistic numeric summary about a sample
