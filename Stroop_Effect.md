## The Stroop Effect

[Stroop Effect](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-stroop-effect-2795832) : In psychology, the Stroop effect is a demonstration of interference in the reaction time of a task. 

Background:

There are some key terms and concepts we should understand, including:


- Selective attention: This is the way we focus on a particular item for a selected period of time.

- Control group: In an experiment, the control group doesn't receive the experimental treatment.
                 This group is extremely important when comparing it to the experimental group to see how or if they differ.
                 
- Independent variable: This is the part of an experiment that's changed.
                        In a Stroop effect experiment, this would be the colors of the words.
                        
- Dependent variable: The part of an experiment that's measured. In a Stroop effect experiment, it would be reaction times.
   
- Other variables: Consider what other variables might impact reaction times and experiment with those.
